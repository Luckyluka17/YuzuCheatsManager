Yuzu Cheats Manager allows you to install, manage and remove cheats automatically on Yuzu. 

**⚠️ This software is experimental, it is not impossible that you find bugs. If this is the case, please contact its creator through [Discord](https://discord.gg/KvjkS3P3Gh).**

## Installation
To install it, you will need to download the file **YuzuCheatsManager.zip** from the [releases page](https://github.com/Luckyluka17/YuzuCheatsManager/releases).
Once it is downloaded, use a tool to **extract** it (WinRar, 7zip or the pre-installed tool in Windows). Then open the **app.exe** file and that's it, Yuzu Cheats Manager is ready!
If you have any problems, try opening the application as an administrator.
